		<h2>Our Identity</h2>
		<center>
		<p>
			

		The Seventh-day Adventist Church sees itself as the remnant Church of end-time Bible prophecy. Members of the Church, individually and collectively, understand their special role as ambassadors of God’s kingdom and messengers of the soon return of Jesus Christ. Seventh-day Adventists have enlisted as co-workers with God in His mission of reclaiming the world from the power and presence of evil, as part of the Great Controversy between Christ and Satan.
		Therefore, every aspect of a Church member’s life is influenced by the conviction that we live in the last days. <a href="https://www.adventist.org/articles/mission-statement-of-the-seventh-day-adventist-church/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

				Seventh Day Adventists accept the Bible as the only source of our beliefs.We concider our movement to be the result of the protestant conviction <i>sola scripta</i> -the Bible as the only standard of faith and practice for christians.
				Currently, Adventists hold 28 fundamental beliefs that can be organized into six categories—the doctrines of God, man, salvation, the church, the Christian life and last day events. In each teaching, God is the architect, who in wisdom, grace and infinite love, is restoring a relationship with humanity that will last for eternity. <a href="https://www.adventist.org/articles/mission-statement-of-the-seventh-day-adventist-church/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

		<h2>Our History</h2>
		<center>
		<p>
			


		Before becoming Seventh-day Adventists, the founders of the denomination were sitting in the pews of other protestant churches in the early-to-mid 1800s. They were farmers, lawyers, teachers…and a handful of Adventism’s prominent early leaders were already involved in pastoral ministry.
		The roots of Adventism can be traced back to the Second Great Awakening, which inspired a spirit of revival throughout the United States in the late 1700s and early 1800s. More people had Bibles in their homes and began to study Scripture themselves rather than leaving that to the clergy. <a href="https://www.adventist.org/articles/mission-statement-of-the-seventh-day-adventist-church/" target="_blank">Learn More</a>
